Family Guess Party Fun Time (FGPFT) is a web-based party guessing game built on Replit, featuring gestures, timers, and custom word lists for multiplayer fun. 

## Project Overview
FGPFT delivers an interactive guessing game perfect for parties, with support for gestures, timed rounds, and user-defined word lists. The app runs entirely in the browser via a single-page HTML/JS setup hosted on Replit. Target users include party hosts seeking quick, no-install entertainment.

## Key Features
- Gesture-based guessing with visual timers for dynamic play.
- Large, editable built in word lists for families 
- Customizable word lists to fit any theme or group.
- Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop parties.

## Default Settings
- Timer: 30 seconds per round
- Rounds: 3 rounds per game
- Selected Category: Only "Animals - Easy"
- Show Buttons: Off (tilt-only mode)
- Haptic Feedback: On
- Sound: On

## Saved between sessions in browser settings:
- Timer duration and number of rounds
- Which categories you have selected
- Button, haptic, and sound preferences
- Any custom word lists you create
- Changes to built-in lists (edits, soft deletes, permanent deletes)

## Quick Start
Visit the live demo at https://familyguesspartyfuntime.replit.app/ to play immediately—no setup required. For self-hosting on Replit, fork the repo, click "Run," and share the generated URL with friends. The app loads assets like fonts and scripts automatically.

## Tech Stack
Built with vanilla HTML, CSS (Outfit and Titan One fonts), and JavaScript modules—no backend or databases needed. Replit handles deployment, serving files from /assets/. View source via browser dev tools for full code inspection.

## Customization
Edit word lists or themes directly in the JS source (likely in /assets/index-CNkwHaR8.js) and re-run on Replit. Add your favicon at /favicon.png or tweak meta tags for custom sharing previews. Test changes live without local setup.

## Contributing
Fork on GitHub or Replit, make changes, and submit a pull request with details on what you fixed or added. Include screenshots of gameplay improvements. Follow standard JS formatting and test on multiple devices.
